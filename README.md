# Analysing Crash Data in QLD
Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers and everything has pattern, even road accidents. In this project, we are working with Queensland’s Road Crash data from 2001-2017. The main goal of this project is analysing the data, finding patterns and trying to predict if certain factors are responsible for crashes. Unlike other projects, this project mainly focuses more on visualising, analysing data and finding patterns than predicting.

## Dataset
This dataset contains information on crashes reported to the police which resulted from the movement of at least 1 road vehicle on a road or road related area.

## Main Aspects

### Summary of the datasets
We will be using crash data from Queensland roads, there are 6 files which will be the main focus of this project:
* Road crash locations
* Road casualties
* Driver demographics
* Seat-belt restraints and helmet use
* Vehicle types
* Factors in road crashes
These data sets were acquired from the Australian data site “data.gov.au”.
Also, there are 2 files from Population Australia and Department of Transport and Main Roads - QLD Government. Files are:
* Population
* Vehicle registration

All information has been publicly released. The files are all in CSV format which makes it easy to import and read. Regarding how clean the data is, unknown values are present so we had to clean the data before we can use it properly. There are also some irrelevant attributes which we was excluded from the analysis, this made the data and final output more coherent.


### Machine Learning Models
* Linear Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Neural Network (MLP Classifier)
